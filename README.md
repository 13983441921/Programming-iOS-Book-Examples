These are the **complete downloadable code examples** for my books, _iOS 8 Programming Fundamentals With Swift_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034278.do>) and _Programming iOS 8_ (<http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920034261.do>) - now **revised for iOS 8** (and **Swift**).

The Swift language keeps changing and occasionally breaks some of the examples, but they were all correct the last time I looked. If there's a problem, it's likely just an exclamation mark or something that needs to be added; I'm sure you can figure it out until I get around to fixing it.

If you find these examples helpful and you haven't purchased the books, please consider doing so.

The downloadable code and screenshots for the previous editions have been moved off to subfolders "iOS7bookExamples" and "iOS6bookExamples". The code for the earlier editions have been archived as "iOS5bookExamples.zip" and "iOS4bookExamples.zip".
